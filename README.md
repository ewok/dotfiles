# What and where

Dotfiles for Arch based distributive with [Nix](https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html) and [Direnv](https://direnv.net/) support.

Editor: [Emacs](https://github.com/ewok/fedora-config/blob/main/roles/emacs/templates/emacs/emacs.org) and [Nvim](https://github.com/ewok/fedora-config/blob/main/roles/nvim/templates/neovim/init.lua).

# Thanks

To [David Wilson](https://github.com/daviwil). His [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAiiOTio8Yu69c3XnR7nQBQ) inspired me to give Emacs a try.
