# What and where

I am using [customized](https://github.com/ewok/ewk-ostree-workstation) ostree based linux distribution based on [Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org).

Development: [Arch based podman image](https://github.com/ewok/fedora-config/blob/main/images/dev/Containerfile) with [Nix](https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html) and [Direnv](https://direnv.net/) support.

GUI: [Flatpak](https://www.flatpak.org/)

Editor: [Emacs](https://github.com/ewok/fedora-config/blob/main/roles/emacs/templates/emacs/emacs.org) and [Nvim](https://github.com/ewok/fedora-config/blob/main/roles/nvim/templates/neovim/init.lua).


# Thanks

To [David Wilson](https://github.com/daviwil). His [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAiiOTio8Yu69c3XnR7nQBQ) inspired me to give Emacs a try.
